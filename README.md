# **Finding Lane Lines on the Road** 

Overview
---

This is a solution for the Lane-detection problem as part of the Udacity nanodegree for self-driving cars. More details on that here: https://github.com/udacity/CarND-LaneLines-P1/

To understand the logic of lane detection, give `writeup.md` a read.

Here's a few samples of how to output of the current lane-detection algorithm coded by me looks like:
